The uploader needs to be cleaned up a lot. We want to be able to continue adding images to an upload queue. There should be more information about what files have been uploaded and what their status is. We may want to reference Flickr, SmugMug, and other photo uploading websites to see what they do.

Albums edit needs to have a drag and drop ability to drop photos into an album, or at least some sort of menu for a photo that allows a user to choose to put it in an album. After this is possible we'll add the ability to sort photos in albums.

Users need a lot of work. We want a username that will be used in the url of users' photo pages. We also want to add an email. Users will be able to log in with their username or email. Eventually we'll add a subscription object. Users without a subscription will be limited in what they can upload. We may limit it to 5 photos or something small, just so they can get a taste of the features. Most other functionality will likely be available.
